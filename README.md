# Depth-Estimation-in-OpenCV-Cpp
This project deploys depth estimation model by OpcnCV and C++.  
The depth estimation model is SfmLeaner that was trained under Oxford Robotics dataset by PyTorch.  
I converted it to onxx file.    
Code were tested under VS2019 and OpenCV 4.5.5.  
onnx file is here.https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KqN8YtzF0mHTPBaOSuj3H4iZ-a3s8xUE/view?usp=sharing  
You may build a vs project. Then put .onnx and .jpg at the same dir with .vsxproj.  
More models will be added in the future.
